   Sketchup is an easy-to-use 3D architectural tool that can be used to design objects and buildings in 3D.
    Some features that make it an ideal program is the ability to type in specific measurements for buildings and objects,
     as well as important readily made objects to decorate your design with. 
     This is not a program that you can easily export into a format for others to explore and would require the downloading of Sketchup.
      However, its tools made it an ideal program for architectural prototyping which could come in handy when designing exhibits. 




   IRL Museums
   Virtual museums
   Both
   Pros
   Customizability great to conceptualize your exhibit in 3D before building
   Can design 3D models and then export as a file to send it to a 3D printer or laser cutter
   
   
   The most customizable program to building a building/exhibit
   Can fully customize exactly what you want your exhibit layout to look like, inserting textures, photos etc
   Models use real measurements so its super easy to compare what the models looks like and how it would look IRL
   Cons
   
   
   Cannot look or interact with the model without being on an “edit” mode
   As the result is a single file, to visit each individual will need to download the file
   The free web browser version has limitations in terms of how complex the shape can be and in terms of what files it can be exported as
   To get a full render, need to install a separate program

   Blender is an extremely powerful and free tool for creating 3D graphics. 
   Blender has been used to make animated films, special effects, art, 3d printed models and even used in creating video games. 
   It is a great platform for modeling, animating, simulating and, in the context of this project, can be used to create very detailed and engaging objects for your virtual museum!

   
Pros
Cons
Is really good for making 3d models and 3d objects.
Can be used to make very intricate and detailed environments
Would be good for making objects that could be integrated into a museum on another platform.


This is a modeling and 3d design program so it is not great for making an environment that someone will interact with unless you make it into a somewhat video game format
Has a steep learning curve and can be complicated for beginners
People coming to see your museum and interact with it will either have to have blender or whatever program you export your blender files to such as unity, unreal etc. which not a lot of people have or they would have to download the museum.
Aren’t able to host other media types (ex. Videos, websites etc)


Overall - Would be great to make environments in very niche scenarios and also great for making individual objects but would not be great for a whole museum itself.

   Gather Town is a web-conferencing software where you and your team members are in a virtual room where you can interact with objects, 
   one another and even work collaboratively with others based on your location in the room. 
   It is styled as an 18 bit game where you can customize your character and explore the space you are in. 
   You can make custom rooms and invite your team to collaborate in a more engaging and fun way than a traditional zoom call.

   
Pros
Cons
Is free (up to 256 people on at 1 time)
So, if you are having people come and go periodically or have time slots for people to see the exhibit then this is a great option


It is live. People can interact with each other in real time. This means you can hold activities and group work if you want.

Has a lot of flexibility. You can show:
Images
Have external calls (through google meet, zoom etc.)
Can have videos 
Can have embedded web pages

Has a lot of intractability
Has synched tv’s so people can view the same things at the same time
Has a podium so someone can speak to everyone in a room at one time
Has whiteboards that people can interact with which can increase engagement
Interactable objects (ex. Can link a google doc as an object)

People can explore on their own time 

Low strain on the computer. Very easy to run


If you want to have more than 25 people on at one time or can’t manage time slots, you will have to pay more which also limits the amount of interactable objects you can use depending on the plan you pay for.
Apparently a little hard to customize 
Also has some connectivity issues from time to time

   With Hubs by Mozzella you can design/create a 3D space and then invite people online to join the space and interact with each other. 
   Completely browser-friendly, it is a great way to mimic the real-life experience of running into someone and having a conversation. 
   Although not the easiest user interface to figure out how to customize the room, it is super easy to meet with other people and interact with an already designed room. 
   

IRL Museums
Virtual museums
Both
Customizability great to conceptualize your exhibit in 3D before building


Can invite people into the place and interact with other users (movement, talking ect)
Can move around in the place, like in IRL
The user doesn’t need to install a new program to use (browser-friendly)
Free to use!
Can install in a discord server (easy collaboration and sharing) 
Can upload photos and videos 




To completely customize an object, (ie one that isn’t in the main shop) you  need a different program to design it
Not the friendliest of user interfaces, does take some time to understand how to use it

               <H1>Why Black History Month is more important than ever this year </H1>
               <p>This summer, Black Lives Matter protests around the world sparked a commitment among many individuals and organisations to educate themselves about Black history, heritage and culture – as part of understanding racism and standing in solidarity against it.</p>
               <p>If that commitment is to transcend beyond social media into real change, everyone, from all communities, needs to embrace Black History Month as a starting point for exploring, discovering and celebrating Black history, heritage and culture – both past and contemporary. From the incredible achievements and contributions, to the many untold stories and barriers to progress – the day-to-day reality of institutionalised racism.</p>
               <p>Black Lives Matter - Sudbury is proud to present to you the Virtual Museum of Black History.</p>

               <H1>The origins of Black History Month in Canada</H1>
               <p>In 1978, the Ontario Black History Society (OBHS) was established. Its founders, including Dr. Daniel G. Hill and Wilson O. Brooks, presented a petition to the City of Toronto to have February formally proclaimed as Black History Month.</p>
               <p>In 1979, the first-ever Canadian proclamation was issued by Toronto.</p>
               <p>In 1988, the first Black History Month in Nova Scotia was observed. </p>
               <p>In 1993, the OBHS successfully filed a petition in Ontario to proclaim February as Black History Month. Following that success, Rosemary Sadlier, president of the OBHS, introduced the idea of having Black History Month recognized across Canada to Jean Augustine, member of Parliament (MP) and Parliamentary Secretary.  Augustine enthusiastically supported the idea. </p>
               <p>In February 2008, Senator Donald Oliver, the first Black man appointed to the Senate, introduced a motion to have the Senate officially recognize February as Black History Month. The motion was approved unanimously and was adopted on 4 March 2008, completing Canada’s parliamentary position on Black History Month in Canada.</p>
               <p>Did you know?</p>
               <p>Jean Augustine was the first Black woman elected to the House of Commons (1993) and the first Black woman to be appointed to Cabinet (2002). Augustine served as Secretary of State in charge of multiculturalism and the Status of Women in the Cabinets of prime ministers Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin.</p>

               <H1>Teaching Black History All Year Long: Striving towards inclusive education</H1>
               <p>The educational pipeline is a period of exploration of one’s identity, place in society and their academic interests. It is a phase where opinions are like clay in its initial stages — if well-shaped it can make a beautiful pot, but mishandling can result in long-lasting effects. </p>
               <p>The curriculum taught to children in school defines the opinions formed at this “early clay” phase but also sets them up for future academic exploration.</p>
               <p>Unfortunately, cultural diversity has yet to be fully integrated into the school curriculums. As demonstrated by the Ontario Black History Society, in Canada, history is only ever taught one way. </p>
               <iframe class="youtubeVideo" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GKm7wQjpuac" style="border:0;"> </iframe>
               <p>It is essential to teach the youth of Ontario about the ways that Black Canadians have contributed to this country, but also the ways in which they have been mistreated by the Canadian government.</p>
               <p>If we want equality for all, we need to confront history as it happened, even if it might make us uncomfortable.</p>
               <p><i>"Have we read our own authors such as Dionne Brand, Afua Cooper and George Elliott Clarke? Do we know that the story of African-Canadians spans four hundred years, and includes slavery, abolition, pioneering, urban growth, segregation, the civil rights movement and a long engagement in civic life?" — Lawrence Hill</i></p>
               <p>— Lawrence Hill, Canadian novelist, essayist, and memoirist. He is best known for his 2007 novel The Book of Negroes, inspired by the Black Loyalists given freedom and resettled in Nova Scotia by the British after the American Revolutionary War.</p>

               <p>In 2016, chapters were established in Vancouver , Edmonton and in Waterloo region.</p>
               <p>In 2021, there are chapters all across Canada, including Sudbury, Ontario that are actively working to dismantle all forms of anti-Black racism, liberate Blackness, support Black healing, and affirm Black existence. </p>
               <p>In addition to fighting against anti-Blackness, we create spaces to build our community. Through alternative forms of education, programming events for our communities, and supporting cultural creation, we believe that we create our own liberation through our commitment to thrive and build beautifully. In our movement for Black liberation, we join calls to decolonize Turtle Island and Nunavut Nunangatas there is no Black Liberation without Indigenous Liberation on Turtle Island.</p>

               <p>Mixed Up explores the isolation of being LGBTQ and BIPOC and the nuanced experience of living between binaries be them orientation, gender and ethnicity. The excerpt you will see explores the juxtaposition of my existence. The intersections of my European and Blackness. What is it like when I am mistaken for white when I exist as both? When I am told I am not black enough to be considered a person of colour.</p>
               <p>In the song you will hear Canadian Tenor Isaiah Bell singing the song entitled "What Power Art Thou" from Henry Purcell’s King Arthur. In the song Arthur freezes to death. I liken this feeling to when I am perceived as white. I get frozen....stuck in a void.</p>
               <p>I’ve often likened my existence to being like a bridge between worlds. The film asks that forgo our usual tendencies to avoid subjects that make us uncomfortable, but rather, face them with a vengeance ul0mately demanding that we celebrate the beauty of differences. MixedUp is available now on OUTtv, Amazon Prime and Apple TV. mixedup.ca</p>
               <p>Howard J Davis aka HAUI is a multidisciplinary artist who defies categorization. He recently released his feature film debut MixedUp produced with Jack Fox and OUTtv. He’s currently in residency with Wildseed Black Arts Fellowship a 20 month paid residency through Black Lives Matter - Toronto. Upcoming he is creating a black opera based upon Canadian contralto Portia White. For more information head to haui.ca</p>
				<p>Two years ago I went to the site that was formerly the Roseland Theatre in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia. What was in 1946 a cinema house is now a refurbished space. What once was the site of racial resistance to segregation is now remembered by few. This is not uncommon in Canada to move our stories of resilience into the peripheries. I am writing a new opera work about Portia White, a famed contralto from Nova Scotia who received international acclaim and fought racial barriers. Viola Desmond was Portia White’s hairdresser and is a character in my new creative work. Women like Viola and Portia are the reason I do what I do. So they can be remembered eternally. These women were trailblazers.</p>

               <p>Q&A Controlled Damage Segment </p>
               <p>Deborah Castrilli</p>
               <p>In 2020, Andrea Scott’s Controlled Damage Premiered at Neptune Theatre in Halifax. This show documents portions of Viola’s life giving us all a deeper understanding of what her experience might have been like as a woman, a person of colour and a person of mixed heritage. Viola was a force to be reckoned with and was never satisfied with the minimum, the small things afforded to people of colour at that time. She had a very specific mixed experience that we must also remember would have been different from what even her husband would have gone through. She was a part of two worlds, neither of which saw her as completely their own. To give some insight into her experience working on this play, we have conducted an interview with the woman who played Viola Desmond herself, Deborah Castrilli.</p>
               <p><b>What is something we might not know about Viola?</b> Viola spent the last days of her life living alone in New York City, working as an entertainment manager.</p>
               	<p><b>You grew up in Halifax - any parallels between your and Viola’s experience?</b> She obviously grew up in a very different time, but it's interesting to see how far we have come in some respects and not in others. Undoubtedly her story is just as relevant today (locally and nationally) as it was 75 years ago.</p>
               <p><b>What was the best part about working on this project? </b>Well in hindsight we now know that COVID-19 hit and shut down the theatre industry merely weeks later, so the fact that we got to tell this story and finish our run in its entirety is such a blessing! I look back on the whole experience and am continuously grateful for it. This story needed to be told, now more than ever.</p>
               <p><b>What was the hardest part of working on this project? </b>Embodying such an important figure that is known across Canada (but especially revered in Nova Scotia) was daunting to say the least! But the work felt so collaborative, and was done in such a way that it felt as though the entire company was carrying her story and her legacy. When injustices are committed it is our collective duty as a community to uphold each other to create effective change; and I think our show did a great job of showing not only the work of the woman alone, but the aspect of the community rallying behind (or shunning) her that was pivotal in her fight for equality</p>

               <H1>Origins</H1>
               <p>Black people have lived in Nova Scotia since before the founding of Halifax in 1749. However, it was only after the American Revolution, in the late 1700s and early 1800s, that large groups of Black settlers began to arrive in the province. Many of them were former enslaved people who had been promised freedom and land in Nova Scotia, but when they arrived, they encountered white settlers who viewed them as inferior.
</p>
               <p>Because of racism, Black settlers were pushed to the margins of society and forced to live on the most inhospitable land. Despite this, they persevered, developing strong, vibrant communities. Africville was one such place.
</p>
               <p>In 1848, William Arnold and William Brown, both Black settlers, bought land in Africville. Other families followed and in 1849, Seaview African United Baptist Church was opened to serve the village’s 80 residents.
</p>
               <p>The church was called “the beating heart of Africville” and was the centre of the village to both church-goers and non church-goers. It held the main civic events, including weddings, funerals, and baptisms. The church’s baptisms and Easter Sunrise Services were well-known. 
</p>
               <p>Black Nova Scotians would line the banks of the Bedford Basin to watch the singing procession leave the church to baptize adults in the basin’s waters. After much petitioning by Africville residents, a school opened in 1883. Previously, a local resident had taught many of the children in Africville before the City school opened.

               <p>Africville residents ran fishing businesses from the Bedford Basin, selling their catch locally and in Halifax. Other residents ran farms, and several opened small stores toward the end of the 19th century. 

					</p>
               <p>In the city, Black women were generally only able to find work as domestic servants and where men were limited to a few jobs such as sleeping car porters on trains. Children swam in Tibby’s Pond and played baseball in Kildare’s Field. In the winter, everyone played hockey when the pond froze.

					</p>
               <p>“You weren’t isolated at any time living in Africville, you always felt at home; the doors were always open. This is one of the most important things that has stayed with me throughout my life” 

					</p>
               <p>-- Irvine Carvery, former Africville resident 

					</p>
               <p>The City of Halifax collected taxes in Africville, but did not provide services such as paved roads, running water, or sewers. Municipal services such as public transportation, garbage collection, and recreational facilities were non-existent.
					</p>
               <p>Africville residents, who paid taxes and took pride in their homes, asked the City to provide these basic services on numerous occasions, but no action was taken.

               <p>In January 1964, Halifax City Council voted to authorize the relocation of Africville residents. Before this decision was made, there was no meaningful consultation with residents of Africville to gather their views. 

					</p>

               <p>In fact, it was later reported over 80 per cent of residents had never had contact with the Halifax Human Rights Advisory Committee, which was the group charged with consulting the community.

               <p>Led by Eddy Carvery and the 'Africville Protest' movement, for 50 years Africville residents have been in search of justice. Today the community and citizens all over the world are uniting as a collective to demand reparations for the once-prosperous black community, Africville.

					</p>

               <p>In 2017 the UN Human Rights Council discussed a report with Canada, regarding issues affecting Black Canadians. A working group laid out dozens of recommendations to redress past and present wrongs affecting Black Canadians, and to consider issuing reparations.


					</p>

               <p>We need to call on the municipal, provincial and federal governments to begin a reparations process that ensures prosperity and quality of life of Africvillians.

               <p>Shown below is a short video piece documenting footage from the original Diva Day Workshop. One of the organization’s Co-Founders, Malindi Ayienga, has contributed commissioned art for the Black Lives Matter - Sudbury social platforms and her work to create a more equitable future around the globe is deeply impactful.</p>
               <p>A little about Diva Day:</p>
               <p><i>“Diva Day uses arts-based education to demystify and normalize menstruation. Established in both Kenya and what is colonially known as Canada, we facilitate empowerment workshops with young menstruators to encourage body literacy, eradicate shame, provide a global perspective on menstrual equity, and create a sense of community. We highlight and provide a variety of menstrual products to offer agency over each participant’s menstrual care. </p>
               <p>Educating and supporting menstruators alone cannot change a culture of shame. We engage non-menstruators and community elders in our workshops to foster empathy for menstruators and enrich the dialogue on how to dismantle society’s oppressive narratives surrounding menstruation.</p>
               <p>Diva Day works towards a future where no day of school is missed due to menstruation.”</i></p>

               <H1>We Shall Overcome: Moving Forward</H1>
               <p>Provided below is an excerpt from Chapter 6 of Reframing the Musical: Race, Culture and Identity. The writer, Sean Mayes, has gifted us with a look at his writing on black erasure throughout history. Though this piece is on the subject of Musical Theatre and Musical Direction, we feel that expressed is a sense of what we can all be striving for within our own vocations. Though this was written pre 2020, Mr. Mayes has given us all something to consider in how we move forward in this Black Lives Matter resurgence and strengthening.</p>

               <p><i>"Through surveillance of role versus race, artist versus labourer, we consider, given our histories, how we seek to move forward.  What is the music director’s role in the history of musical theatre? How are we benefiting and serving our art in preserving it? And how can this be accomplished?</p>

               <p>In the beginning to answer these questions, I would propose that anyone who is ignorant of their past is in proper form to repeat it. Examining the historical relevancy and providing additional survey on the people who are responsible for designing the function of the music director is crucial in uncovering how they worked, and what individual contributions to the field were provided.  ...Accolades can be frequently tossed out with a pat on the back in accomplishing integration - for example, many individuals have been in turns cast as “the first” African American music director or conductor: variously William Accooee in 1896; Will Marion Cook in 1903; Everett Lee for Carmen Jones (1943); Cornelius Tate for Hair (1969); and Dr Joyce Brown as the first woman for Purlie (1970). The inconsistency within identification allows for these names to slip through the cracks, along with many others not mentioned at length in this chapter but eager for unearthing: Shelton Becton, Joseph Joubert, Zane Mark, Daryl Waters, Linda Twine, Joyce Brown, Chapman Roberts, Neal Tate, Thom Bridwell, Leah Richardson, Margaret Harris, Danny Holgate, Harold Wheeler, Frank Owens, Hank Jones, J. Leonard Oxley.  All of these people, despite discovery sometimes only within buried archives, have laid a pathway worth exploration.  As those whose names are forgotten are unearthed, we discover in their methodologies how their work was developed. </p>
				<p>...Ultimately, the reconstruction of lost labours - both in role and in race - must be embraced for what it needs to be: a reconstruction.  The acknowledgement of the shortfalls within our theatre community in fully acknowledging the music director in all its realms, whether in recognition in performance to the public via greater prominence, in equal appreciation through our own circles (reinstating that ‘Tony Award for Music Direction’?) or by sheer higher virtue in embracing greater ownership in the rehearsal space. Not only must we embrace this within the role, but we must accept the history of a standardized approach towards the liminal nature of this role, and by doing so, reject the closed institutionalized tendencies of the colour-blind past in opening up opportunity to leaders of all multiplicities. This could hold no more truth than within the periphery of the theatre practionary community. Black practitioners must seek to lead musicals that sit outside of a Black-centralized idiom, while the theatre community must actively seek to employ practitioners of all minority standings in all shows, regardless of casting, setting or profile. Exploration of Black works by Black practitioners is impactful but not enough; transparency throughout the entire community is key in the synthesis of dissolving current constraints of liminality, intersectionality and institutional permanence for not only minority music directors but music direction at large. Institutionalized permanence of expectations within the role and race must be rejected, as homogeneity of approach to style and content is discarded and all practitioners are guided into projects across all spectrums. The impetus points in a promising direction, but the road is long, and we must be wary of taking our hands from the steering wheel."</i></p>

                  <pre><p>
At dawn my mother stands on the hill
behind our house
and invokes the sun to rise
then she goes to the outdoor kitchen
and prepares tortillas and cocotea for our breakfast

My mother sells fruits and flowers in the market
stuff she grows with her own hands
she does not solicit customers
they come to her of their own volition
and at the end of each day
her items are all sold out

Now at age 42 my mother decides to stop having children
but not because her blood has ceased
"I have peopled the world with the numerous men
and women that my body has birthed," she says
"now it's time for me to birth other things"

At times my mother's back and feet grow tired
so I anoint them with coconut oil
her feet is a detailed map
her back is the starapple tree outside our front door

My mother has never travelled abroad
but she knows tales of everyland
she says the flowers in her gardens
especially the ginger lily, orchids,
and the bird of paradise, bring her such tidings

My mother is short in stature
all her children tower above her
some do not even want to recognise
or acknowledge her as they pass by in the marketplace
they are ashamed of this fruit and flower woman
this woman who fed them milk and tortillas
that made them so strong
sometimes they mock her
"she looks like something out of a Rivera mural," they jest
but my mother does not hear
her ears are beyond their words.
In the evening when she grows weary
my mother sings lullabies to the sun to entice it to sleep
so the dark can come and we all be rejuvenated
"It's in the darkness that we grow strong," she tells us

How wise she is
this woman with a life that no one can capture
how essential she is
this woman who makes gardens flower
and who feed us milk and tortillas
I watch her as she descends the hill to the marketplace

her skirt at her knee
her black hair flecked with grey
