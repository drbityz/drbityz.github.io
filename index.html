   Sketchup is an easy-to-use 3D architectural tool that can be used to design objects and buildings in 3D.
    Some features that make it an ideal program is the ability to type in specific measurements for buildings and objects,
     as well as important readily made objects to decorate your design with. 
     This is not a program that you can easily export into a format for others to explore and would require the downloading of Sketchup.
      However, its tools made it an ideal program for architectural prototyping which could come in handy when designing exhibits. 




   IRL Museums
   Virtual museums
   Both
   Pros
   Customizability great to conceptualize your exhibit in 3D before building
   Can design 3D models and then export as a file to send it to a 3D printer or laser cutter
   
   
   The most customizable program to building a building/exhibit
   Can fully customize exactly what you want your exhibit layout to look like, inserting textures, photos etc
   Models use real measurements so its super easy to compare what the models looks like and how it would look IRL
   Cons
   
   
   Cannot look or interact with the model without being on an “edit” mode
   As the result is a single file, to visit each individual will need to download the file
   The free web browser version has limitations in terms of how complex the shape can be and in terms of what files it can be exported as
   To get a full render, need to install a separate program

   Blender is an extremely powerful and free tool for creating 3D graphics. 
   Blender has been used to make animated films, special effects, art, 3d printed models and even used in creating video games. 
   It is a great platform for modeling, animating, simulating and, in the context of this project, can be used to create very detailed and engaging objects for your virtual museum!

   
Pros
Cons
Is really good for making 3d models and 3d objects.
Can be used to make very intricate and detailed environments
Would be good for making objects that could be integrated into a museum on another platform.


This is a modeling and 3d design program so it is not great for making an environment that someone will interact with unless you make it into a somewhat video game format
Has a steep learning curve and can be complicated for beginners
People coming to see your museum and interact with it will either have to have blender or whatever program you export your blender files to such as unity, unreal etc. which not a lot of people have or they would have to download the museum.
Aren’t able to host other media types (ex. Videos, websites etc)


Overall - Would be great to make environments in very niche scenarios and also great for making individual objects but would not be great for a whole museum itself.

   Gather Town is a web-conferencing software where you and your team members are in a virtual room where you can interact with objects, 
   one another and even work collaboratively with others based on your location in the room. 
   It is styled as an 18 bit game where you can customize your character and explore the space you are in. 
   You can make custom rooms and invite your team to collaborate in a more engaging and fun way than a traditional zoom call.

   
Pros
Cons
Is free (up to 256 people on at 1 time)
So, if you are having people come and go periodically or have time slots for people to see the exhibit then this is a great option


It is live. People can interact with each other in real time. This means you can hold activities and group work if you want.

Has a lot of flexibility. You can show:
Images
Have external calls (through google meet, zoom etc.)
Can have videos 
Can have embedded web pages

Has a lot of intractability
Has synched tv’s so people can view the same things at the same time
Has a podium so someone can speak to everyone in a room at one time
Has whiteboards that people can interact with which can increase engagement
Interactable objects (ex. Can link a google doc as an object)

People can explore on their own time 

Low strain on the computer. Very easy to run


If you want to have more than 25 people on at one time or can’t manage time slots, you will have to pay more which also limits the amount of interactable objects you can use depending on the plan you pay for.
Apparently a little hard to customize 
Also has some connectivity issues from time to time

   With Hubs by Mozzella you can design/create a 3D space and then invite people online to join the space and interact with each other. 
   Completely browser-friendly, it is a great way to mimic the real-life experience of running into someone and having a conversation. 
   Although not the easiest user interface to figure out how to customize the room, it is super easy to meet with other people and interact with an already designed room. 
   

IRL Museums
Virtual museums
Both
Customizability great to conceptualize your exhibit in 3D before building


Can invite people into the place and interact with other users (movement, talking ect)
Can move around in the place, like in IRL
The user doesn’t need to install a new program to use (browser-friendly)
Free to use!
Can install in a discord server (easy collaboration and sharing) 
Can upload photos and videos 




To completely customize an object, (ie one that isn’t in the main shop) you  need a different program to design it
Not the friendliest of user interfaces, does take some time to understand how to use it
